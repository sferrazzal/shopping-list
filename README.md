# [Shopping List App for Web and Mobile](https://github.com/sferrazzaf/shopping-list)

## Description
This app is designed with a few features in mind to deliver superior functionality vs. a paper shopping list. Specifically:

- User defined **Recipes** - collections of items that can be added to or removed from the list as a set.
- User defined **Tags** help with item categorization.
- **(Upcoming feature)** Shopping lists remember **Staples** - a set of items that will always be on the list.
- **(Upcoming feature)** Users can highlight items or sort lists based on tags.
